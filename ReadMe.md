According to the [U.S. Forest Service][1] "invasive  species have contributed to the decline of 42% of U.S. endangered and threatened species, and for 18% of U.S. endangered or threatened species, invasives are the main cause of their decline."

So, what is an invasive species? An invasive species is one that is foreign to the local ecosystem and has the potential to cause economic or environmental damage.

Our mission is to research the feasibility of using thermal imaging to recognize the heat signatures of these invasive species. We want to be able to use drones mounted with thermal cameras to recognize and plot the locations of these plants. Specifically targeting densely populated areas so that efforts can be focused to more efficiently control the invasion.
