# Invasive Species Mapper (ISM)

According to the [U.S. Forest Service][1] "invasive species have contributed to the decline of 42% of U.S. endangered and threatened species, and for 18% of U.S. endangered or threatened species, invasives are the main cause of their decline."

So, what is an invasive species? An invasive species is one that is foreign to the local ecosystem and has the potential to cause economic or environmental damage.

Our mission is to research the feasibility of using thermal imaging to recognize the heat signatures of these invasive species. We want to be able to use drones mounted with thermal cameras to recognize and plot the locations of these plants, specifically targeting densely populated areas so that efforts can be focused to more efficiently control the invasion. The drone will operate on designated routes searching for invasive species. When the thermal camera registers that it has spotted the invasive species it will then plot the location and species that it found.

The goal of this project is twofold: 
* To make the process of locating and identifying the invasive species an easily implemented passive process, allowing the customer to spend more time on other potentially more important tasks, increasing efficiency.
  
* To make the end product affordable to the point that a ?common/smalltime? farmer is able to afford a decent number of the drones without being a financial burden. 

##  Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```CSharp
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running

Say what the step will be

```CSharp
Give the example
```
 
And repeat

```CSharp
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

##  Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```CSharp
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```CSharp
Give an example
```
